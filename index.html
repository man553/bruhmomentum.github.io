<p style="text-align: center;">Now, today we will be learning about "bruh momentum." Now, to understand "bruh momentum", we must first understand what a "bruh moment" is. Now, a "bruh moment" is a moment eliciting such strong emotional reaction from a person, that they can only react with "bruh." Now, how large or small that "bruh" is, will determine its "bruh mass." For example, Karen taking the kids will carry a much larger "bruh mass" than when your pizza rolls are not finished. Now, how fast this situation hits you will determine its "bruh velocity", represented by V, and do not forget that it is a vector quantity. Now, combining your knowledge of these two things, you can find "bruh momentum", also a vector quantity, by the factor of its "bruh mass" and "bruh velocity." Now, try it!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We will give you an example on how to calculate the bruh momentum of the current image:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>:noescape:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Using the formula bM = mV, aka&nbsp;Bruh Momentum equals the mass of the Bruh times the velocity of the Bruh, we can calculate how bruh this :noescape: emoji is, deducing from the calculation of the image, we can see that it is 4319000% a bruh moment from the current values:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">m equals 35 kgs as Sonic weighs 35 kilograms</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">v equals 1234 kms per hour as he was stated to run at the speed of sound in his classic days</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">35kg x 1234kms =&nbsp;43190kg*m/s</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Thank you for listening to our current theory of the Bruh Momentum, it was such a bruh moment as a srb2fail! Check out srb2fails.us.to to see more epic fails!</p>
